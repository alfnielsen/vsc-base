# vsc-base

vsc-base as a module that aims to make it esaier to create vscode extensions.

It's also the base for using the [vsc-script extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alfnielsen.vsc-script) and [vsc-scaffolding extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alfnielsen.vsc-scaffolding).

Documentation can be found on [vsc-base.org](http://vsc-base.org)

Release note can be found on vsc-base's [github wiki](https://github.com/alfnielsen/vsc-base/wiki/Release-notes)

**WARNING:**
This is still not version 1.0.0, and changes to methods and their names will come before the final first version.

## Get started

```
>> npm i vsc-base
```

or

```
>> yarn add vsc-base
```

When you only use vsc-base for vsc-script and/or vsc-scaffolding, you can install it as devDependency instead:

```
>> npm i vsc-base --save-dev
```

or

```
>> yarn add vsc-base -D
```
